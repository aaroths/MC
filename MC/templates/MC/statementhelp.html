    <p>Statements are things that you <b>Do or Think or Feel</b> when you are well.</p>
  </div>
  <div class ="textbox2">
    <p>You can think of them as <b>goals</b> to perform. However, they are often small things that don't require major changes. To perform these statements, it often involves us paying a bit more attention.</p>
    <br>
    <p>One way to think of statements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Recall a time in your life in the past few years you were feeling well</li>
      <li> Were there certain activities that you were doing? </li>
      <li> Were there certain thoughts you were having? </li>
      <li> Were there certain feelings that you were having? </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="textbox2">
    <h2>A statement should:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Start with "I ..." or a verb "eg: Doing, Feeling, Being, Trying, Going etc"</li>
      <li> May be the cause of you feeling well</li>
      <li> <b>Or</b> may be something you do because you feel well</li>
    </ul>
